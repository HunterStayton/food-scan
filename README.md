# food_scan

Application that can scan barcodes/nutrition facts labels to aid in health/fitness tracking available on android/ios devices built with Flutter

## What's Next?

I would like to build this application to push to the app store and allow users to have a free way to track their health,
as there is no reason for healthy habits to have a paywall behind them.
